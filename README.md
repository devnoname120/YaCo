# YaCo - Collaborative Reverse-Engineering for IDA
# YaDiff - Symbols Propagation between IDA databases

## [Latest Releases](https://github.com/DGA-MI-SSI/YaCo/releases)

## Yaco 

**YaCo** is a [**Hex-Rays IDA**](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/) plugin enabling collaborative reverse-engineering on IDA databases for multiple users. Incremental database changes are stored & synchronized through **git** distributed version control system.
Both offline & online work is supported.

### Motivation

**IDA** does not allow multiple users to work on the same binary.
During large malware analysis, we had to use a team of reversers and manual synchronization is a tedious and error-prone process. 

**YaCo** goals are:

  * Support all **IDA** events
  * Be fast, users must not wait for synchronisation events
  * Prevent conflicts between users
  * Be user-friendly & easy to install
  
## YaDiff 

**YaDiff** is a standalone command-line tool allowing symbol, comment, enum & struct propagation between distinct IDA databases.

### Motivation

There are two major uses cases for YaDiff
    
  * Merging previously analyzed binary symbols into an updated binary
  * Merging debug symbols from an external library into another stripped binary
    
### Usage

  * Uncompress the release into a directory
  * Prepare two separate directories for each IDA database
  * Call merge_idb.py on those two databases
```
python $yatools_directory/YaTools/bin/merge_idb.py $source_dir/source.idb $destination_dir/destination.idb
```
  * Open ```$destination_dir/destination.yadiff_local.idb``` and check results

## Installation

### Debian stretch/x64

**YaTools** like **IDA** 7.1 is 64-bit only.

Install dependencies
```
sudo apt install build-essential git cmake libpython2.7 libpython2.7-dev
```

Set IDA_DIR & IDASDK_DIR environment variables
```
export IDA_DIR=/opt/ida7.1/
export IDASDK_DIR=/opt/idasdk71/
```

Clone, configure & build **YaTools**
```
~/YaTools (master) $ cd build
~/YaTools/build (master) $ ./configure.sh
~/YaTools/build (master) $ pushd ../out/x64_RelWithDebInfo
~/YaTools/out/x64_RelWithDebInfo (master) $ make -j4
~/YaTools/out/x64_RelWithDebInfo (master) $ make test -j4
~/YaTools/out/x64_RelWithDebInfo (master) $ pushd $IDA_DIR/plugin
$IDA_DIR/plugin $ ~/YaTools/build/deploy.sh
```

### Windows

CMake & Python 2.7 64-bit must be installed and in the PATH
Only visual studio 2017 is currently supported

Configure and build **YaTools**
```
# export directories without quotes
set IDA_DIR=C:\Program Files\IDA Pro 7.1
set IDASDK_DIR=C:\idasdk71
build> configuref_2017.cmd
out/x64> cmake --build . --config RelWithDebInfo
out/x64> ctest . --output-on-failure -C RelWithDebInfo -j4
```

## YaCo Usage

### First user
To create the **YaCo** environment:

  1. open binary or idb file as usual
  2. click on Edit menu, Plugins, YaCo
  3. enter path to git remote (could be a file system path, or empty to use current dir)
  4. a warning will inform you that **IDA** have to be re-launch with correct idb
  5. **IDA** auto close
  6. launch **IDA** for your FILE_local.idb file
  7. save database
  8. start working as usual

Warning, to use with multiple user, **YaCo** project must be in a bare git project.

### Other users
Setup **YaCo** environment:

  1. clone a **YaCo** project
  2. open idb/i64 file with ida
  3. click on Edit menu, Plugins, YaCo
  4. a warning will inform you that **IDA** have to be re-launch with correct idb
  5. **IDA** auto close
  6. launch **IDA** for your FILE_local.idb file
  7. save database
  8. start working as usual
  
### How it works
**YaCo** use a git server to synchronize changes between users.

In the local repository, **YaCo** stores the original IDB and incremental changes as xml files & commits.

Note that the database is not modified anymore unless you force a synchronisation.
When saving the database, we fetch remote changes, rebase local changes on top of those, import this new state into IDA and push this state to the remote git server.

Any git server should work, like github, gitlab or gitea instances.

Currently, **YaCo** only support SSH authentication. To keep the plugin user-friendly, there is no mechanism which ask for passwords & passphrases on every git operation. Instead, it is recommended to use an ssh agent, like pageant under windows or ssh-agent under linux.
